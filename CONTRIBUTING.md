## Code of Conduct

We hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By
participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few
general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Linear Tickets and PRs before creating your own.

### Tracking

We use Linear to plan and track features, bugs and releases. Please ensure the
branch name matches the ticket number in Linear prior to creating your PR. If
you do not have access to Linear, a maintainer can provide access or create the
corresponding ticket for you.

Issues created in Github by individuals that do not have access to Linear,
should have a corresponding ticket in Linear for tracking internally.

### Pull Requests

All code changes are done through PRs. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread
  whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed, changed or added functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

We automatically run continuous integration to ensure the quality of the code
that is merged. Maintainers will not allow a PR to be merged unless all checks
continue to pass.
